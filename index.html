      <h1>An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.</h1>

        <p>
            The bullet pierced through his eyes, causing imminent death. The reason was very simple, I asked him and others who were present in the bank to lie down on the ground with hands on their heads. Like a classic bank robbery story or news articles-everybody save an over smart accountant trying to grab a hike- jumps into the scene and henceforth his family pays later.
        </p>
        <p>The eyeball has been crushed and the socket is filled with blood, the body lies down with his back facing the ground. Instant silence. Funny that people don’t acknowledge threat until the example is given. Haha.
        A small girl child started to cry, breaking the lovely silence, her mother trying to stop her, thinking she’s in grave danger by breaking the silence. Girl stands up crying, her mother pulls her hand to lie her down again and she starts crying even louder in lieu of listening to her mother.
        I see her. One of my six teammates shouts, ‘Fire bullet in the leg until need not to and don’t hurt a child. You know why.’
        We seven are all black monkey cap masked robbers, entered in bank to rob it, of course. The calculations have been fine so far. We placed booby traps around the bank so that no backup can reach us in a given time frame, one was asked to visit the bank in civil dress and ask for things in lockers and when he opens that, we would barge in and I’ll control the public (with one more there to assist if need to be) and rest will go and collect money after disconnecting every source of communication to the outside world.</p>
      <p>I sit down near the body, legs folded, pistol on the floor. That’s how fear works, it cripples the very bravery inside you. The bullet passed his skull so I entered my finger in the hole. The blood embraces my finger like it was meant to be on my finger, forever. I licked it. Tastes so good.</p>
      I hold the gun in my hand, gesture the crying girl to come near me. The mother follows her. I gesture her to stop there, just the girl. She senses something bad and she is so afraid that it chokes her, she stops crying.
      She is fair in color, ponytail braid and don a red top and skirt with black spots spread all over the dress, imitating a watermelon, perhaps, she’s playing with her fingers and walking slowly.
      I hold her wrist gently. I now have a minor hostage, as all would think, except the one who refused me to hurt her.
      <p>With the other hand, I fire a bullet in the other eye of the body and laugh, like a maniac, a cruel laugh. ‘You dumb fool, you laughed at me. I told you I’ll ‘see you’. You laughed at me?’ I don’t believe in quotes. I promised my daughter, even if it makes the whole world blind, I’ll definitely take ‘your eye’ and then you gotta try seeing, again.’</p>
      <p>
      To be honest, this isn’t just a robbery. I really hate this man. Employees like these are paid for nothing, and the whole banking system is as meaningless as Facebook application in our phone. Just like a classic story, a man whose daughter is seriously ill and doesn’t have a high source of income and hence can’t apply for loans which eventually leads to the death of the innocent. I remember him refusing me loans every time I tried my best. He always postponed. My daughter couldn’t. She died, in the same age group as the girl in front of me. Poor lad.
      My brother, the one who warned me for hurting her, made me swear that I’ll try my best that no other daughter shall die an early age. He’s watching me. I know he’s. We gathered the team to become a Robin, as far as what I’ve told them.
      Banks have CCTV, and I purposely left them working, till now.
      I give the girl a ring attached to a thread which goes deep in my jacket and she holds that in one finger. I say her in her ears, ‘Pull it quickly.’
      She follows, like a good girl.</p>
      <p>Like a good parent, I hold her both hands, dropping my pistol, I of course no longer need it.<br />
       A chain of M67 Fragmentation grenade attaching to a single thread and all those are now unpinned because of the pull of the little girl. I’m not just a robber. I’m a human bomb.
      Seven seconds left.</p>
      <p>My brother realized what has just happened. We all are gonna die, right here.
      He jumps to me, shouting all teammates to run away.</p>
      <p>Five seconds left.</p>
      <p>This girl really looks like my daughter. Just that she was happy, and my daughter never got a chance to be any single day. It’s funny they say that terror is spread by people with arms and ammunition. It’s really spread by the people in suits.</p>
      <p>Four seconds left.</p>
      <p>I unmasked myself, face towards the CCTV. M67 will nearly kill all, but not impact the corners, as much as I expect. Police will surely recognize me if they see the past footages. My reason will now be broadcasted on TV. I’m a hell kind of attention seeker.</p>
      <p>I smile towards the money in bags. They’re gonna burn down. Told you, I’m no Robin. I don’t tolerate people in suits. I don’t like criminals. I serve them all, justice. My brother reaches me and grabbed me.</p>
      <p>‘What was that?’</p>
      <p>One second left.</p>
      <p>It’s too late.</p>
      <p>Zero.</p>
      <p>Sorry, little girl. You don’t just look like my daughter, I think you’re my daughter, and that really hurts me deep down.</p>
      <p>A big silence. I smile. I laugh. And then, I burst into pieces with a loud noise taking down all those criminals and hostages who serve greater purpose, broadcasting the need to stop the terror served by people in suits.</p>
      <p>The building will collapse. The blood spots and organs will be found halter and shelter. The investigation will commence. My daughter sacrificed herself. This girl sacrificed herself. Someone will narrate the story. Someone will watch it. Maybe they won’t get to the point why I did what I did. But I really don’t care.
      My world has died already.</p>
      <p>I don’t feel bad killing a few more’s now.</p>
